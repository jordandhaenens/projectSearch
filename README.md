# projectSearch

This app was developed to ease the pain of searching for flights and lodging when you don't have a particular destination in mind. In order to run this app you'll need to have a API key, an Google Firebase account, and a decent amount of setup.

To ease this burden, I'll be hosting this app in the near future to allow people to demo the app without downloading anything. In the meantime, feel free to take a look at the code!


UPDATE:
It seems that some of the free APIs I built the app around have been updated and the existing codebase no longer returns a search result. As a remedy, I will be building my own RESTful API to serve up flight data harvested from around the web.
