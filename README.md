# projectSearch

This app was developed to ease the pain of searching for flights and lodging when you don't have a particular destination in mind. In order to run this app you'll need to have an API key,a Google Firebase, and a decent amount of setup.

To ease this burden, I'll be hosting this app in the near future to allow people to demo the app without downloading anything. In the meantime, feel free to take a look at the code!
